Recent MacOS wants password to be at least 8 chars,
have digits and characters, no repeated or consecutive chars,
and wants to change the password every 90 days.

Here is how to remove most of thiese complicated requirements
and set password to a single character:

In Terminal:

1.
pwpolicy getaccountpolicies > ~/Desktop/file.plist
cp ~/Desktop/file.plist ~/Desktop/file.plist.orig

2.
Edit file ~/Desktop/file.plist

    Delete the first line, which says "Getting global account policies"

    Then do changes (from - to) as following:
    
    from:  <string>policyAttributePassword matches '.{8,}'</string>
    to:    <string>policyAttributePassword matches '.{1,}'</string>
    
    for policyAttributeExpiresEveryNDays
    from: <integer>90</integer>
    to:   <integer>3000</integer>
    
    for policyContent 
    from: <string>policyAttributePassword matches '^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).+'</string>
    to  : <string>policyAttributePassword matches '^(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).+'</string>
    
    for policyAttributePasswordHistoryDepth
    from: <integer>5</integer>
    to:   <integer>1</integer>

Save the changes

3.
pwpolicy setaccountpolicies ~/Desktop/file.plist
passwd
security set-keychain-password
