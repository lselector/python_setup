MacOS Mojave wants password to be at least 4 chars.
Here is how to set it to allow 1 char:

pwpolicy getaccountpolicies > ~/Desktop/file.plist
nano ~/Desktop/file.plist

   Delete the first line, which says "Getting global account policies"
   Change the Regex
      policyAttributePassword matches '^$|.{4,}+'
   to 
      policyAttributePassword matches '^$|.{1,}+'

pwpolicy setaccountpolicies ~/Desktop/file.plist
passwd
